### Migrate an existing `particle engine` component from v2 to v3
If you have created an `particle engine` component using `particle engine` v2, this section will help you move it to use `particle engine` v3.
#### Step 1 
`cd` into the component directory, and delete the component from the Kubernetes cluster:
```shell
particle engine delete
```
#### Step 2
Download and [install particle engine v3](../overview/installation.md).

#### Step 3
Run [`particle engine dev`](../command-reference/dev.md) to start developing your application using `particle engine` v3.

#### Step 4
Run `particle engine list` to see a list of components that are running on the cluster and what version of `particle engine` they are running.

### Where are `particle engine push` and `particle engine watch` commands?
`particle engine push` and `particle engine watch` have been replaced in v3 by a single command - `particle engine dev`. 

In v2, if you wanted to automatically sync the code on developer system with the application running on a Kubernetes
cluster, you had to perform two steps - first `particle engine push` to start the application on the cluster, and second `particle engine watch`
to automatically sync the code. In v3, `particle engine dev` performs both actions with a single command.

`particle engine dev` is not _just_ a replacement for these two commands. It's also different in behaviour in that, it's a 
long-running process that's going to block the terminal. Hitting `Ctrl+c` will stop the process and cleanup the 
component from the cluster. In v2, you had to use `particle engine delete`/`particle engine component delete` to delete inner loop resources 
of the component from the cluster.

### What happened to Ingress/Route?
If you have used `particle engine` v2, you must have used Ingress (on Kubernetes) or Route (on OpenShift) to access the 
application that was pushed to the cluster using `particle engine push`. `particle engine` v3 no longer creates an Ingress or a Route. Instead,
it uses port-forwarding.

When running `particle engine dev`, `particle engine` forwards a port on the development system to the port on the container cluster allowing 
you remote access to your deployed application. It also prints the information when the application has started on the
cluster:
```shell
$ particle engine dev
...
...
-  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 8080
```
This indicates that the port 40001 on the development system has been forwarded to port 8080 of the application 
represented by the current `particle engine` component.

:::info NOTE
`particle engine` no longer supports creation of Ingress / Route out of the box. The `particle engine url` set of commands no longer exist 
in v3.
:::

### Changes to the way component debugging works
In `particle engine` v2, `particle engine push --debug` was used to run a component in debug mode. To setup port forwarding to the component's
debug port, you had to run `particle engine debug port-forward`.

In `particle engine` v3, you need to specify the debug port in the `devfile.yaml` as an endpoint, and run `particle engine dev --debug` to 
start the component in debug mode. For example, a `container` component in the devfile should look like below, where 
port 3000 is the application port and 5858 is the debug port:

```yaml
- name: runtime
  container:
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-12:1-36
    memoryLimit: 1024Mi
    endpoints:
    - name: "3000-tcp"
      targetPort: 3000
    - name: debug
      exposure: none
      targetPort: 5858
```
### Changes to default configurations

#### Ephemeral storage

By default, `particle engine` v2 used [ephemeral storage](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/storage/understanding-ephemeral-storage.html) 
for the components created using it. However, this has changed in `particle engine` v3, and it now uses the underlying storage 
(Persistent Volumes) configured for use by the users. If you would like to continue using ephemeral storage for `particle engine` 
components, you could change the configuration by doing:
```shell
particle engine preference set Ephemeral true
```

### Commands added, modified or removed in v3

The following table contains a list of `particle engine` commands that have either been modified or removed. In case of a 
modification, the modified command is mentioned in the `v3` column. Please refer below legend beforehand:
* 👷 currently not implemented, but might get implemented in future
* ❌ not implemented, no plans for implementation
