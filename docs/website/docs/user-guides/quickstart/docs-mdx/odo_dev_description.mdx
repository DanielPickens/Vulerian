Now that we've generated our code as well as our Devfile, let's start on development.

`particle engine` uses [inner loop development](/docs/introduction#what-is-inner-loop-and-outer-loop) and allows you to code,
build, run and test the application in a continuous workflow.

Once you run `particle engine dev`, you can freely edit code in your favourite IDE and watch as `particle engine` rebuilds and redeploys it.

<p>Let's run <code>particle engine dev</code> to start development on your <span>{props.framework}</span> application:</p>

<Tabs groupId="quickstart">

  <TabItem value="podman" label="Podman">

  ```console
  particle engine dev --platform podman
  ```
<details>
    <summary>Sample Output</summary>
    {props.devpodmanout}
</details>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

  ```console
  particle engine dev
  ```
<details>
    <summary>Sample Output</summary>
    {props.devout}
</details>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="openshift" label="OpenShift">

  ```console
  particle engine dev
  ```
<details>
    <summary>Sample Output</summary>
    {props.devout}
</details>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then wait a few seconds until `particle engine dev` displays `Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:...` in its output,
meaning that `particle engine` has successfully set up port forwarding to reach the application running in the container.

You can now access the application via the local port displayed by `particle engine dev` ([127.0.0.1:20001](http://127.0.0.1:20001) in the sample output above) and start your development loop.
`particle engine` will watch for changes and push the code for real-time updates.
