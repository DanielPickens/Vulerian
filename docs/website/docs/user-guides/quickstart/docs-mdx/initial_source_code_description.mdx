We will create the example source code by using some popular frameworks.

Before we begin, we will create a new directory and cd into it.
```shell
mkdir quickstart-demo && cd quickstart-demo
```

This is *optional* and you may use an existing project instead (make sure you cd into the project directory before running any particle engine commands) or a starter project from `particle engine init`.
