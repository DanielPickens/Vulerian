# Features of particle engine

By using `particle engine`, application developers can develop, test, debug, and deploy microservices based applications on Kubernetes without having a deep understanding of the platform.


- Thanks to a library of [predefined Devfile stacks](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer) you don't have to worry about setting up your build pipelines.
- `particle engine` allows you easily develop application while it is running on Kubernetes cluster. 


Take a look at the "Using particle engine" documentation for in-depth guides on doing advanced commands with `particle engine`.
