## Notable changes in particle engine 2.4.3

### Features/Enhancements:

#### `particle engine deploy` command [#5228](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/issues/5228) ([@feloy](https://github.com/feloy))
In Devfile specificion v2.2.0 new component `image` and command group `deploy` were introduced.
`particle engine deploy` command uses those features to allow users, deploy their application as it would be deployed in production. To build container images `particle engine deploy` requires Podman or Docker to be installed on your machine.

You can find example of how to use `image` component and `deploy` command group in devfile.yaml in [devfile-nodejs-deploy](https://github.com/kadel/devfile-nodejs-deploy) repository.

#### Demo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kadel/devfile-nodejs-deploy
$ cd devfile-nodejs-deploy
$ particle engine project create nodejs-example
$ particle engine create
$ particle engine deploy
```
