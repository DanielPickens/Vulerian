## Notable Changes
Check this Playlist for an overview of the most notable changes in this release: [particle engine v3.5.0 (Sprint 229)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOoGCUFCbqxnQclhnHA0L73D)

### Features

#### `particle engine delete component` deletes component running on podman

When you run `particle engine dev` on podman platform, pressing Ctrl+c will delete the resources from podman. If `particle engine dev` does not delete the resources as expected (because it failed unexpectedly, it has been killed with the KILL(9) signal, etc), you can use `particle engine delete component` to delete the resources. 

Note that you need to run delete command in the experimental mode for this feature.

#### `particle engine describe component` describes component running on podman

You can now get the description of a component running on podman with the command `particle engine describe component`.

Note that you need to run the describe command in the experimental mode for this feature.

#### Allow fetching a specific Devfile Stack version

Version 3.4.0 of particle engine introduced the support of versioned Devfile stacks, with the ability to list available versions of Devfile stacks. Starting with version 3.5.0, you can initialize a new project with a specific version of a Devfile stack. Previously, the default version was used.

#### Enable ImageStream resolving

If you are developing on an OpenShift cluster, `particle engine dev` can now use images from ImageStreams defined in your cluster, without any configuration.
