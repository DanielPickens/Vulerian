### Features

#### Experimental Mode ([#6150](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/pull/6150))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkrkvQew2X0" title="Experimental Mode" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There is now an Experimental Mode in `particle engine` that can be enabled by exporting `particle engine_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=true` to your environment. All the new features will be generally available under this mode, giving you an opportunity to try them out sooner.

#### `particle engine dev` using Podman  ([#6151](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/pull/6151))
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EmN_hGkOHX4?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOr5pjbPTdcWsIrOezCPXWdX" title="particle engine dev using podman" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You can now use`particle engine dev` to run your application on Podman. `particle engine` leverages the benefit of Podman to work seamlessly with Kubernetes YAML and replicate them to containers locally.
This is an experimental feature and can be used with `--run-on` flag.

#### `particle engine list namespaces` is now available in JSON format ([\#6257](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/pull/6257))

#### `particle engine describe component` can now list Routes/Ingresses ([\#5990](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/pull/5990))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cRA5uaMSQ_4?list=PLGMB2PY4SNOr5pjbPTdcWsIrOezCPXWdX" title="`particle engine describe component`: List Routes/Ingresses deployed by particle engine deploy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Applications deployed in the `Deploy` mode often include resources such as Routes (on OpenShift) and Ingresses (on Kubernetes) to allow access to an application.
`particle engine describe component` can now list these resources.
