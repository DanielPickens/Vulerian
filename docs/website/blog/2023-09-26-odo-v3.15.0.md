#### [Dev UI] Deleting single item from multi-value fields

This adds the ability in the particle engine dev UI to delete single items from multi-value fields:
- container endpoints
- volume mounts
- multi-text fields, like Container Command and Args, or Image Build Args
- multi-key-value fields, like Container Env Vars, Deployment Annotations and Service Annotations
- multi-commands fields, in use in Composite Commands
