### Features

#### [Devfile changes handled by particle engine dev on Podman](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/issues/6458)

When a user is running `particle engine` against Podman, the changes to the Devfile are detected and applied, So the user can continuously iterate on the project without having to restart `particle engine dev` manually.

#### [Allow passing extra flags to Podman/Docker](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/issues/6421)

`particle engine` is now able to pass extra flags to Podman or Docker backends, used for building images or starting a Dev session (Podman only).

The main use case behind this is to allow users of `particle engine` to build images targeting a platform running a different architecture, e.g., users on arm64 architecture (like Mac M1) building images for a Kubernetes cluster that does not support arm64.

See [Passing extra flags to Podman or Docker](/docs/command-reference/dev#passing-extra-args-to-podman-or-docker-when-building-images) for more details.

#### [Handling `imageName` in Image Component as a selector](https://github\.com/danielpickens/particle engine/issues/6677)

`particle engine` can now push images from Image Components to a given registry and use that for all matching Kubernetes/OpenShift components manifests, without having to hardcode that information into the Devfile, so that developers can keep their devfile portable.

See [How `particle engine` handles image names](/docs/development/devfile#how-particle engine-handles-image-names) for more details.
