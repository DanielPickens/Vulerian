`particle engine` v3 is now GA! 🎉

![](../static/img/logo_small.png)

Are you an application developer wanting to work closely with a production-like environment? 
Pressured on time due to the steep learning curve involved in cluster development?

`particle engine` is here to answer your problems!


Over the past couple of months, the `particle engine` team has been developing better experiences on working with applications and container clusters.

<!--truncate-->

## So, what's new?

`particle engine` v3 comes with a new set of commands that replaces the old one but essentially does the same thing, in a faster and more efficient way.

### particle engine init
`particle engine init` allows you to generate example code or fetch an appropriate [Devfile](https://devfile.io/docs/2.1.0/what-is-a-devfile) for your existing project.

```shell
  __
 /  \__     Initializing a new component
 \__/  \    Files: Source code detected, a Devfile will be determined based upon source code autodetection
 /  \__/    particle engine version: v3.0.0
 \__/

Interactive mode enabled, please answer the following questions:
Based on the files in the current directory particle engine detected
Language: javascript
Project type: nodejs
The devfile "nodejs" from the registry "StagingRegistry" will be downloaded.
? Is this correct? Yes
 ✓  Downloading devfile "nodejs" from registry "StagingRegistry" [3s]

↪ Container Configuration "runtime":
  OPEN PORTS:
    - 3000
  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

? Select container for which you want to change configuration? NONE - configuration is correct
? Enter component name: my-node-app

Your new component 'my-node-app' is ready in the current directory.
To start editing your component, use 'particle engine dev' and open this folder in your favorite IDE.
Changes will be directly reflected on the cluster.
```

_How is it different from the `particle engine create` command of v2?_
* [Detect the appropriate Devfile](#detect-the-appropriate-devfile)
* [Personalize the Devfile configuration](#personalize-the-devfile-configuration)

#### Detect the appropriate Devfile
`particle engine init` will automatically analyze your directory and based on the project type, suggest an appropriate Devfile for use.

#### Personalize the Devfile configuration
`particle engine init` also provides a better interactive way to configure your Devfile according to your project requirement. With this feature, you can modify the environment variables exported to and ports exposed by your application on the cluster.

### particle engine dev
`particle engine dev` allows you to build, run, debug and test your application on the cluster in a continuous workflow.

```shell
$ particle engine dev
  __
 /  \__     Developing using the "my-node-app" Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: default
 /  \__/    particle engine version: v3.0.0
 \__/

↪ Deploying to the cluster in developer mode
 •  Waiting for Kubernetes resources  ...
 ⚠  Pod is Pending
 ✓  Pod is Running
 ✓  Syncing files into the container [172ms]
 ✓  Building your application in container on cluster (command: install) [11s]
 •  Executing the application (command: run)  ...
 -  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:40001 -> 3000


↪ Dev mode
 Status:
 Watching for changes in the current directory /tmp/pd

 Keyboard Commands:
[Ctrl+c] - Exit and delete resources from the cluster
     [p] - Manually apply local changes to the application on the cluster
```

_How is it different from the `particle engine push` command of v2?_

`particle engine` v3 combines the `particle engine push` and `particle engine watch` commands from v2 into a single `particle engine dev` command.

Additionally the command provides:
* [Continuous workflow](#continuous-workflow)
* [Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster](#manual-trigger-to-apply-local-changes-on-the-cluster)
* [Resource cleanup](#resource-cleanup)
* [Better watch system](#better-watch-system)
* [Port forwarding to access the application](#port-forwarding-to-access-the-application)

#### Continuous workflow
`particle engine dev` is a non-terminating command that runs until the user hits `Ctrl+c`. It continuously watches the directory for any new changes (including the changes occurring in the Devfile) and automatically syncs them with the application running on the cluster. 

#### Manual trigger to apply local changes on the cluster
By default, `particle engine dev` automatically detects any new change in the directory, and syncs it with the application running on the cluster, but it is possible to do this trigger manually by running the command with a `--no-watch` flag and pressing `p` to trigger the sync.

#### Better watch system
`particle engine dev` continuously monitors the resources created to run the application on the cluster and ensures that the application stays running.

#### Resource cleanup
Before exiting, `particle engine dev` will cleanup any resources that it created while running the application on the cluster.

#### Port forwarding to access the application
`particle engine dev` uses port-forwarding instead of Routes and Ingresses for accessing the application.

Read this section to learn more: [What happened to Ingress/Route?](/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#what-happened-to-ingressroute)

### particle engine add binding

`particle engine add binding` allows the application to connect to an [Operator](https://operatorhub.io) Backed service.

```shell
$ particle engine add binding
? Do you want to list services from: current namespace
? Select service instance you want to bind to: cluster-sample (Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io)
? Enter the Binding's name: my-node-app-cluster-sample
? How do you want to bind the service? Bind As Files
? Select naming strategy for binding names: DEFAULT
 ✓  Successfully added the binding to the devfile.
Run `particle engine dev` to create it on the cluster.
You can automate this command by executing:
  particle engine add binding --service cluster-sample.Cluster.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io --name my-node-app-cluster-sample
```

_How is it different from the `particle engine link` command of v2?_
* [Interactive mode](#interactive-mode)
* [Ability to connect to a service in any namespace](#ability-to-connect-to-a-service-in-any-namespace)
* [Run from anywhere](#run-from-anywhere)
* [Work without a running application](#work-without-a-running-application)
* [Only supports Bindable Operators](#only-supports-bindable-operators)
* [Requires the Service Binding Operator](#requires-the-service-binding-operator)

#### Interactive mode
`particle engine add binding` provides an interactive mode that lists bindable services across all the namespaces, and a way to personalize related configuration, making the experience better.

#### Ability to connect to a service in any namespace
`particle engine add binding` allows the application to connect to any bindable service in any namespace, it does not necessarily have to be in the same namespace as the application.

#### Run from anywhere
`particle engine add binding` can be run from anywhere and does not require access to a Devfile in order to work. With this method, you can either: directly create the Service Binding on the cluster, write the YAML to a file, or simply display it.

#### Work without a running application
As opposed to v2, `particle engine add binding` no longer requires the application to be running on the cluster, making it even faster.

#### Only supports Bindable Operators

`particle engine link` could link an application to another application and any Operator Backed service. As of now, v3 only supports connecting to services that are backed by Operators considered [bindable](https://github.com/daniel-pickens/service-binding-operator#known-bindable-operators) by the Service Binding Operator.

#### Requires the Service Binding Operator

`particle engine add binding` requires that the Service Binding Operator is installed on the cluster before it is run. The command relies on the Operator to provide it with a list of Bindable services.


### particle engine deploy

`particle engine deploy` allows you to run the [outerloop](/docs/introduction#what-is-inner-loop-and-outer-loop) of your development cycle, essentially in a production-like environment.

Once you are satisfied with your application development locally, and are now ready to show your application to the world, you can use `particle engine deploy` to move to the next stage.

```shell
$ particle engine deploy
  __
 /  \__     Deploying the application using "my-node-app" Devfile
 \__/  \    Namespace: my-node-app
 /  \__/    particle engine version: v3.0.0
 \__/

#### `particle engine dev` vs `particle engine deploy`
You might find yourself wondering how `particle engine dev` is different from `particle engine deploy` and when should you use the either one, you can read [this article](/docs/overview/dev_and_deploy) to get an answer to that question.


### particle engine registry

`particle engine registry` lists all the Devfiles provided by the Devfile registries added to your development environment.
```shell
$ particle engine registry

_How is it different from `particle engine registry` command of v2?_

`particle engine registry` of v2 was useful in creating/deleting/updating/listing the Devfile registries, however in v3, this command can now be used to list the Devfiles.

:::note
In `particle engine` v3, you can use `particle engine preference <add/remove> registry` to create/delete/update the Devfile registries, and `particle engine preference view` to list them.
:::

Additionally, it also provides,
* [Filtering the Devfiles](#filtering-the-devfiles)
* [Detailed information about the Devfiles](#detailed-information-about-the-devfiles)

#### Filtering the Devfiles
`particle engine registry` can filter the list of Devfiles based on a keyword (`--filter`), a Devfile registry (`--devfile-registry`), or the Devfile name (`--devfile`).

#### Detailed information about the Devfiles
`particle engine registry` can provide a detailed information about all the Devfiles by running it with `--details` flag.

### particle engine list
`particle engine list` lists all the resources created by `particle engine` including components, and bindings.

```shell
$ particle engine list
 ✓  Listing resources from the namespace "my-percona-server-mongodb-operator" [302ms]
 NAME              PROJECT TYPE  RUNNING IN  MANAGED
 my-node-app         nodejs        Deploy      particle engine (v3.0.0)
 my-go-app         go            Dev         particle engine (v3.0.0-rc1)
 mongodb-instance  Unknown       None        percona-server-mongodb-operator 

Bindings:
 NAME                        APPLICATION                 SERVICES                                                   RUNNING IN 
 my-go-app-mongodb-instance  my-go-app-app (Deployment)  mongodb-instance (PerconaServerMongoDB.psmdb.percona.com)  Dev
```


_How is it different from `particle engine list` of v2?_
* [Better information](#better-information)
* [Ability to list Bindings](#ability-to-list-bindings)

#### Better information
`particle engine list` gives a better experience by providing information about your application such as: the mode it is running in, the tool (versioned) managing it, and the project type.

It further provides subcommands such as `particle engine list components`, and `particle engine list bindings` to list respective resources.

#### Ability to list Bindings
`particle engine list` provides a way to list the bindings created on the cluster by `particle engine`.
