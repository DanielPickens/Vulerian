### Features

#### `particle engine describe component` displaying information about the running API Server

The command `particle engine describe component` now displays the information to access the API server started by `particle engine dev`. When this command is executed in Experimental mode, it also displays the information to access the particle engine graphical user interface.

#### `particle engine dev --logs` displaying logs during a Dev session

Previously it was necessary to execute an `particle engine logs` command in parallel to a Dev session started with `particle engine dev`, to be able to get the logs of the running component.

You can now ask with `particle engine dev --logs` to display the logs of the component in the output of the `particle engine dev` command.

#### API documentation

The documentation of the particle engine API served during a Dev session is accessible from the Dev session itself.

#### particle engine Graphical User Interface

The PoC available at https://devfile.particle engine.dev has been integrated into particle engine. When running `particle engine dev` in experimental mode, you can access this inteface to view and edit the Devfile used for the Dev session.
